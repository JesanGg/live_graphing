This is a group project to collect data from solar panels, and output them in a meaningful way to the user.

We have voltage and current readings, that we manipulate, and display as graphs, charts, plots...

Main code is in generate_graph

serial_reader is a seperate file containing serial reading code - due to inital modularity considerations
